## 🌍 What is NEURO-ESTATE?

**NEURO-ESTATE** is an open-source framework for creating high-tech, autonomous, and economically viable settlements ("Agro-Polises"). It combines the philosophy of **Ancestral Estates** with the power of **AI, Blockchain, and Permaculture**.

We solve the "Urban Fatigue" crisis by offering a turnkey solution:
**1 Hectare of Land + Smart Infrastructure + Global Connectivity = Freedom.**

## 🚀 Key Features (The "Sexy" Tech)

### 1. 🧠 AI-Driven Ecosystem (Digital Twin)
*   **Precision Nature:** AI monitors soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
*   **Predictive Farming:** Neural networks advise *what* to plant and *when* for maximum yield.
*   **Health Monitoring:** Integration with wearables to track the "Health ROI" of living in nature.

### 2. 🏗️ Construction 2.0 (Modular & Prefab)
*   **House as a Gadget:** 3D-printed and CLT-modular homes assembled in 72 hours.
*   **Growing Architecture:** Start with 45m² and add modules ("plug-ins") as your family/capital grows.
*   **Zero-Energy:** Passive house standards, solar roofs, and hempcrete walls.

### 3. ✈️ Sky Mobility (Aviation Hub)
*   **Fly-in Community:** Dirt strips for Cessnas and Gyrocopters in every cluster.
*   **Drone Logistics:** 24/7 autonomous delivery of medicine and goods.

## 💻 The Code: Economic Simulation

This repository contains the `Neuro_Estate_OS.py` — a Python script that simulates the economic lifecycle of a family estate over 20 years.

### Quick Start

**Option 1: Run in Terminal**
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/NeuroLoft/NEURO-ESTATE.git

# Run the simulation
python Neuro_Estate_OS.py
```

**Option 2: Interactive Notebook**
Prefer a visual interface? Open `Neuro_Estate_Simulation.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code to run the model step-by-step.

**What it calculates:**
*   💰 **Financial Capital:** Cash flow from remote work, organics, and tourism.
*   🌳 **Natural Capital:** Value of soil, timber, and carbon credits.
*   🤝 **Social Capital:** Community value and reputation.
